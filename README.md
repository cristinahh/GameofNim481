# GameofNim481

This code is a Python class, GameOfNim, that defines the rules of the Game of Nim.

1. Two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps or rows
2. In each turn, a player must remove at least one object from the same row
3. The player that removes the last object loses the game

This is not a search game algorithm implementation, rather this is an extension of the Game class in [games.py](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/games.py). It is an implementation of the class with game rules such that it can be used with an adversarial search algorithm to play optimally against any opponent.
